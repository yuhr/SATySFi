# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- Fix how to handle font stretch values (a strange behavior due to this bug had first been reported by `zeptometer`, and the cause of the bug was suggested by `matsud224`).
- Support OCaml 4.10 (encouraged by [PR\#207](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/207) by `na4zagin3`, [PR\#3 for `gfngfn/camlpdf`](https://github.com/gfngfn/camlpdf/pull/3) by `y-yu`, and [PR\#223](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/223) by `yasuo-ozu`).
- Uses `yojson-with-position.1.4.2+satysfi` instead of `yojson.1.4.1+satysfi` in order to avoid version conflicts with `yojson` required by `merlin` etc.
- Improve how listings are typeset by `itemize` package.

### Added
- Add new primitive `string-explode : string -> int list` ([PR\#202](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/202) by `puripuri2100`).
- Add new primitives `log : float -> float` and `exp : float -> float`.
- Extend the syntax and the semantics for allowing code texts directly written in inline texts ``{… `…` …}`` and add new primitive `set-code-text-command : [string] inline-cmd -> context -> context`.
- Add `List.is-empty`, `List.map-with-ends`, and `Option.is-none`.

## [0.0.4] - 2020-01-25
### Fixed
- Rename math command `\centerdot` to `\cdot` ([PR\#114](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/114) by `nekketsuuu`).
- Does not fail when a script value evaluates to `OtherScript` ([PR\#121](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/121) by `na4zagin3`).
- Handles `CR`+`LF` correctly as one line ending ([PR\#122](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/122) by `matsud224`).
- Fix how to generate ToUnicodeCMap as to ligatures ([PR\#140](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/140) by `matsud224`).
- Fix bug of `\ref` in `stdjareport` ([PR\#135](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/135) by `matsud224`).
- Fix bug of signature matching in the type checker ([PR\#143](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/143) and [PR\#144](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/144) by `elpinal`).
- Fix bug of type inference about records ([PR\#148](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/148) by `elpinal`).
- Fix bug about decoding fonts that has NULL as the DefaultLangSys entry in a Script table.
- Fix (a kind of) bug about decoding fonts that has NULL in a BaseRecord table ([PR\#164](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/164) by `matsud224`).
- Fix the page breaking algorithm.
- Fix how to detect cyclic synonym type definition(s) ([bug reported by `nyuichi`]((https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/issues/187))).
- Fix how to embed fonts (by updating `otfm` from `v.0.3.6+satysfi` to `v.0.3.7+satysfi`, which was due to [a PR](https://github.com/gfngfn/otfm/pull/7) by `matsud224`).

## Added
- Begins to support Markdown input.
- Supports PDF hyperlinks ([PR\#113](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/113) by `matsud224`).
- Supports fixed-length list patterns ([PR\#123](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/123) by `nekketsuuu`).
- Supports PDF outlines ([PR\#134](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/134) by `matsud224`).
- Reports detailed error messages when a given image file is invalid ([PR\#138](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/138) by `matsud224`).
- Provides new primitives `get-leftmost-script : inline-boxes -> script option`, `get-rightmost-script : inline-boxes -> script option`, and `script-guard-both : script -> script -> inline-boxes -> inline-boxes`.
- Regards `<LIBROOT>/local/packages/` as a place for user-defined packages.
- Uses `<LIBROOT>/local/hash/fonts.satysfi-hash` (as well as `<LIBROOT>/dist/fonts.satysfi-hash`) for a font fash file (the same holds for `<LIBROOT>/local/hash/mathfonts.satysfi-hash`).
- Supports (non-extensible) record updates, i.e., `(| <record> with <label> = <new-value> |)`.
- Supports a MetaML-like two-stage computation performed by *bracket* `& <expr> ` and *escape* `~ <expr>` and equipped with (a somewhat restrictive variant of) cross-stage persistence.
- Uses `"$(pwd)/.satysfi/"` as one of the library roots, and provides option `--config <colon-separated paths>` (or `-C …`) for adding arbitrary paths to the library roots ([PR\#161](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/161) by `nyuichi`).
- Supports the insertion of images by `![…](…)` in Markdown sources ([PR\#139](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi/pull/139) by `hikalium`).
- Supports the local import `@import: …` for the text-generating mode (i.e. supports importing `.satyh-*` or `.satyg` files).
- Provides a new primitive `omit-skip-after`.
- Provides new options `--debug-show-block-bbox` and `--debug-show-block-space`.
- Allows `[]` (i.e. the empty list) or `(| |)` (i.e. the empty record) as an expression argument of commands.
- Add new primitive `abort-with-message` (which is equivalent to OCaml’s `failwith`).
- Add new primitives `lift-int`, `lift-string`, etc. for lifting basic values in two-stage computation (which may be, however, replaced with a more general single primitive operation based on *cross-stage persistence*).
- Add the MacroML-like notion of macro based on two-stage programming.
- Supports two-column page break.

## Deprecated

- The use of `"src-dist":` entries in font hash files is deprecated; use `"src":` instead, which requires a font file’s path relative to `<LIBROOT>`. An entry of the form `"src-dist": "<path/to/font-file>"` is now treated equivalently to `"src": "dist/fonts/<path/to/font-file>"`.

## [0.0.3] - 2018-10-09
### Fixed
- Does NOT insert spacing between different scripts when the [line breaking class](http://unicode.org/reports/tr14/) of the posterior charcter is CL, CP, QU, NS, JLCP (= [JLreq cl-02](https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/ja/#cl-02)), JLFS (= [JLreq cl-06](https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/ja/#cl-06)), or JLCM (= [JLreq cl-07](https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/ja/#cl-07)).

### Added
- Supports the application of math commands to optional arguments.
- Provides primitives `set-space-ratio-between-scripts` and `get-space-ratio-between-scripts`.

## [0.0.2] - 2018-08-09
### Fixed
- Make type inference algorithm firmer (mainly about records and optional arguments).

### Changed
- Conforms to a new operational semantics as to optional arguments.
- Starts reporting error for duplicated fields in a record expression.
- Improve type error report as to application of non-function expressions.

## 0.0.1 - 2018-08-05
### Added
- Initial version of SATySFi
